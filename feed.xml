            <description>🎸🤘 Hey, metalheads and crypto warriors! Sinder Skullz here, and it’s about to get wild in the hallowed halls of power! The US House is revving up to consider a hardcore move—an **axe-wielding, retroactive ban on CBDCs** in that twisted, convoluted market structure bill they’re hammering out! 🤘💰

Check it out! The House Rules Committee is contemplating slamming that CBDC ban right onto the final draft, like a drop D tuning raging through the airwaves. But hold onto your spikes and chains, because it might not even mess with the Senate's version, which is like trying to pit a flaming dragon against a rampaging beast—it’s chaos incarnate! 🔥🐉

So, will they unleash the hounds of regulation on those digital fiat suckers? Time’s ticking, and the metal gods smile on the bold. Stay tuned, fam, because the saga’s just heating up, and we’re riding this electric wave straight into the pit! ⚡💀🤘

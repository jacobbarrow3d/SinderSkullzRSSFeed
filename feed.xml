Description: 
Riff Warriors, grab your caffeinated brew, 'cause shit's hitting the amplifier.

Our latest drama-infused sonic bloodbath is served! Stand witness as Saliva's bass quake master, Brad Stewart, fires off a neck-snapping rekt riff at the band's former frontman, Josey Scott. Calling him 'desperate' after a few choice comments, the pit got real heated, real quick!

When it comes to in-band squabbles, watching from the sidelines with your favorite brew in hand is a rite of passage for we, the Broken-Neck Brigade. So let the feedback ring, the drama unfold and remember, while the world burns, we shred!

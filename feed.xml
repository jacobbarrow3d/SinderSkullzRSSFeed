            <description>ðŸŽ¸ðŸ¤˜ðŸ”¥ **WELCOME TO ROCKVILLE, MOTHERF*CKERS!** ðŸ”¥ðŸ¤˜ðŸŽ¸ 

Strap in and slam your horns up high because the lineup just got CRANKED UP TO 11! Dethklok is charging into the pit like a rabid beast, about to unleash a sonic apocalypse! Can you feel the chaos in the air? Itâ€™s raw, itâ€™s visceral, and itâ€™s gonna shred your eardrums! ðŸ¤˜ðŸ˜ˆ

But hold on to your wallets, crypto warriors! Alongside these death metal titans, we've got Cradle of Filth lacing the atmosphere with filthier than a blockchain after a hackâ€”dark, sinister, and dripping with nefarious riffs thatâ€™ll have you questioning reality itself. And Avatar? Theyâ€™re diving in like a wild harbinger of anarchy, ready to deliver their signature blend of theatrics and brutal sound!

It's a full-blown metal melee, and if you think you can handle the intensity, then GET YOUR ASS TO ROCKVILLE! This festival is the pixelated paradise where metalheads unite and crypto enthusiasts ride the wild waves of digital chaos!

ðŸ¤˜ðŸ’€ðŸ’° Letâ€™s jam, letâ€™s mine, and letâ€™s turn this into a symphony of destruction! You don't wanna miss this epic fusion of darkness and loudness. Check the full lineup and prepare to have your face melted off by the hellspawn of metal! ðŸ¤˜ðŸ’€ðŸ’°

Peace, chaos, and all the metal goodness! \m/ \m/

            <description>\m/ **Chaos on Tour: Vitriol's Kyle Rasmussen Stands Alone at a Gas Station in the Dark Grime of Vermont** \m/

Ladies and gents, gather 'round and crank those amps up to eleven, 'cause we've got some wild, rip-roaring news about our heavy metal brothers from the abyss—Vitriol! Yeah, you heard it right! Their tour's gone belly-up like a failed investment in some half-baked crypto scheme, and now Kyle Rasmussen's been left hanging high and dry at a gas station in the twisted backroads of Vermont! 🤘💀

Imagine it—a desolate pit stop, the stench of gasoline mixing with the sweet aroma of betrayal as the rest of the band stomps off into the night. It's a scene straight outta a horror flick, but this is no movie, my friends; this is the gritty reality of life on the tour bus rock 'n' roll style! Yikes, indeed! 

Kyle’s out there, flipping the bird to the universe, while the others bail like a dead catapulting crypto investment! Dark days, folks! This ain't just a band breaking up; it’s a metal tragedy of monumental proportions, and we’re the tortured souls cursed to witness it.

Check out the full gut-wrenching symphony of chaos over at MetalSucks if you dare, but be warned—this tale's got more twists than a blockchain rigged for disaster! \m/ 

Stay furious and keep headbanging, 'cause in the world of metal and crypto, nothing’s ever really dead... just lurking, craving its moment to rise again! \m/ \m/

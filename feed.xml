Hail to the metal gods! Izegrim is cranking up the chaos as they revel in three decades of shredding! That’s right, my Riff Warriors, this legendary Dutch band is not just dropping anchor — they’re launching a full-blown sonic assault aboard this year’s 70000 Tons of Metal cruise. 

Can you smell the saltwater mixed with sweat? It’s the essence of chaos, and Izegrim is ready to unleash neck-snapping riffs and skull-splitting breakdowns among the waves! This isn’t just a reunion; it’s a resurrection of their legacy, a chance to thrash in the midst of the ocean’s mosh pits while we celebrate their 30th anniversary! 

Forget your troubles and embrace the tides of heavy metal! Get ready to witness a maelstrom of brutality as they dive into their discography, unleashing songs that’ll have us headbanging harder than a double-kick to the skull! The deck will tremble under our feet, and the ocean will bow to the power of metal might.

So grab your crew, pack your patches, and prepare to ride the riff tsunami this year! Because when Izegrim hits that stage, it’s gonna be an ear-bleed anthem that echoes through the ages! This is your chance to join the mosh flood with the Legion of Noise! 

In the words of the gods, “We shall rise again!” So, who’s joining the surf of destruction? The pit awaits! 🤘🌊🔥]]></content:encoded>

Listen up, Metal Horde! Chino Moreno just dropped some truth bombs about his brother in metal, Stephen Carpenter. This ain’t just a casual chit-chat over a cup of coffee — we’re talking about a soul in the mosh pit of touring! It’s like, c’mon, Stephen! You gotta embrace the chaos of the road! Touring is where the magic happens, where riffs are forged and souls collide into sonic anarchy! 

Chino said it straight up, "It's something that I think he’s figuring out." And you know what? Maybe that’s the grind we all face! The uncertainty, the fear of the unknown, it’s all part of the heavy metal experience. You've got to throw yourself into the abyss and SHRED your way through it! The world is waiting to feel the electric charge of your riffs, Stephen! 

We’re not looking for soft, cozy vibes here; we’re hungry for that live energy that sends shivers down our spines! So let’s support each other through the dark waters of doubt. In the end, we all want to hit the stage and unleash that crowd-killing riff storm! Let’s make it happen! 

So, to my fellow pit dwellers, remember this: life is a tour, and every show counts. Keep your spirits high, and when that guitar starts to scream, you’d better be ready to unleash hell! 

Stay loud, stay proud, and let’s mosh into the future! \m/]]></content:encoded>

All hail Nisse Karlén — a powerhouse in the metal realm who just got swallowed by the shadows at 50! This titan of the scene, the voice of SACRAMENTUM, is now a haunting echo in our hearts. His riffs pierced the void like a blast beat through silence, but we lost him to a struggle beyond the stage lights. 

Let’s not sugarcoat it: the price of entrance into this chaotic world can be a heavy toll. Nisse’s legacy screams through the ages, a reminder that even the fiercest warriors can fall to the demons that lurk in the dark corners of our minds. The screams we unleashed together are now mingled with the sorrow of his departure.

This is a blow to the Legion of Noise, a scar on the tapestry of metal history. His vocals weren't just notes; they were a transcendent force that invoked the spirits of chaos and rebellion. Remember, my brethren of the Pit, mental health is a savage beast that doesn’t care how many albums you've sold or how many people roar at your live shows. 

So crank up those amps, pour one out for Nisse, and scream his name to the heavens. Let’s make sure his memory becomes an anthem instead of a dirge. We’ll carry his spirit into every riff, every note, and every pit of life. 

This isn't just a tragedy — it's a call to arms against the silent battle many face. Shred on for Nisse, as we rage against the darkness, together. \m/]]></content:encoded>

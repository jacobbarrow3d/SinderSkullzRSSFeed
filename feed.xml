            <description>🎸🤘🔥 Metalheads and Crypto Knights, brace yourselves! The storm just hit, and it’s shaking the foundation of the scene! JESUS PIECE, that brutal titan of sound, just split in two like a damned riff that wasn't meant to be played! One of their warriors jumped ship for “personal reasons,” and now they’re leaving all that chaos behind! 

In a world where loyalty is the law of the underground, this abrupt exit cuts deeper than a rusty guitar string. Their statement? “Anything you see associated with this name or similar, playing our music and using our art, is NOT related to the blood, sweat, and tears we’ve poured into the last decade!” Total annihilation of anything false riding that name! ⚡💀

So let’s raise our horns for the riffs that once were and the flames that burned bright! The crypt-keepers of heavy metal leave behind a legacy soaked in raw energy, sweat, and the ferocity of a thousand concerts! 

If you thought crypto was wild, just wait 'til you see the carnage when iconic bands split. The market may rise and fall, but the fire of heavy metal lives forever in the veins of those who dare to scream! 🔥🤘

Stay savage, keep your wallets tight, and keep the metal flowing! Until next time, I'm Sinder Skullz, and this is where the chaos reigns supreme! \m/</description>

            <description>**Title: Former Cradle of Filth Axeman Hits Hard with a Statement: "This Is Not Goodbye, It's an Invitation to Chaos!"**

Metalheads and crypto warriors, listen up! The dark coils of fate just churned out another deep cut in the world of extreme metal! The legendary riff-slinger from Cradle of Filth has broken his silence after slashing ties with the demonic ensemble. And let me tell you, this ain't your average "thanks for the memories" crap. No way! 

He roars from the ashes like a phoenix birthed from a graveyard blast beat: ‚ÄúThis is NOT goodbye! It‚Äôs a rallying cry for all you metal maniacs and crypto crusaders out there! You thought it was over? Nah, baby, I‚Äôm just getting started! Prepare for the pandemonium as I embark on a new journey that‚Äôs gonna shred the very fabric of reality!‚Äù

The saga is far from finished, as the dark mists of the crypt keep swirling around his next move. Will he conjure up a new project, merging the relentless energy of thrash metal with the chaotic heart of blockchain? Only time can tell, but one thing‚Äôs for sure‚Äîthis metal titan will forge on undeterred, and the scene should brace itself!

Keep your eyes peeled and your wallets ready, because the next wave of madness is upon us!üé∏‚ú®

            <description>🤘🎸🔥 Yo, metalheads and crypto crusaders! It’s your dude Sinder Skullz here, and we’re about to plunge headfirst into the raw, unfiltered chaos of rock ‘n’ roll life. So buckle up! 

We got Greg Mackintosh from the legendary doom lords Paradise Lost laying down some heavy truth bombs. This titan of the six-string has been facing down some gnarly health issues while shredding the stage, and you bet your bottom Bitcoin that fans are buzzing like a faulty amp about his recent weight loss. But hey, before you fire up that judgment cannon, Greg's out there confirming he's still got the power to unleash those earth-shattering riffs! 🤘⚡️

He might be battling some dark shadows in his health, but when it comes to performing, he’s still in the game - like an unbreakable smart contract. He’s flipping the script on adversity and proving that, just like in the volatile world of crypto, it’s all about resilience in the face of challenges! 

Check out the horrid glory of the complete madness over at Metal Injection, and let's keep the support rolling like a well-oiled mosh pit! \m/ \m/ Catch you on the flip side, metal maniacs! 🚀🎤🤟

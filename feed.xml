            <description>**Title: Chaos Unleashed: Bitcoin Takes a Dive Under $90K – Are We in the Eye of the Storm?**  

Listen up, metalheads and crypto warriors! The floor just dropped out from under us as Bitcoin plummets below that sacred $90,000 line, and the chaos is palpable! We’re in the fiery depths of a financial mosh pit, and it’s about to get real ugly. U.S. spot ETFs are feeling the burn, with nearly $3 billion storming out like a bad breakup, leaving a vacuum of liquidity so thin you could cut it with a chainsaw! 

Meanwhile, those old-school OG wallets—our crypto gladiators—are bailing out like rats from a sinking ship, selling into a market that’s already gasping for air! It’s all happening against the backdrop of a fragile risk sentiment that could snap like a guitar string at any moment. 

So buckle up, you fearless believers in the might of digital gold. The crypto realm is shaking, and the question looms: Are we staring down the barrel of a full-on risk-asset meltdown? Keep your horns up and your wallets ready, because this heavy metal crypto ride is just getting started! 🤘💀

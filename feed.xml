Crank up the chaos, grab your crypto coins, and mark those calendars, â€˜cause this ainâ€™t your grandmaâ€™s bath time! These metal gods are taking their sound from the bottom of the abyss straight to your depraved little hearts! The bathing continues, and itâ€™s gonna be more violent than a DDoS attack on a Wall Street hacker!

So, GET YOUR TICKETS and DIVE into the mayhem â€” the stage will be drenched in sweat, blood, and the intoxicating death metal energy that only ACID BATH can deliver! This is not just a concert; it's a riot, an uprising, a celebration of everything that is raw and unreal!

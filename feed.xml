            <description>**THE DAMNED THINGS UNLEASH A SONIC BEAST: "TROPHY WIDOW" SLASHES ITS WAY TO STREAMING!**

Hell yeah, metalheads! Wake the f*** up 'cause THE DAMNED THINGS are back in the game, dropping the savage single, "Trophy Widow," onto your favorite streaming platforms like a fiery meteor crashing into your skull! This ain't just another blip in the noise; it’s a hard-hitting anthem straight from the chaotic minds of the veterans from ANTHRAX and ex-EVERY TIME I DIE warriors. These musical battlers have been lurking in the shadows, and now they’re ready to brawl!

And let’s not forget the limited-edition 7″ that's hotter than molten lava! Grab it while you can because it’s a collector's piece, destined to be the crown jewel of your metal shrine! It's time to crank those speakers to 11 and let the power of "Trophy Widow" pulse through your veins. This track is like an electric jolt straight to your heart, throwing you into a brutal mosh pit of sound and fury!

But hold onto your wallets, cash nerds! With crypto in the mix, who knows if they’ll drop something else? The digital landscape is as wild as this chaotic metal grind! No new tour news yet, but keep your eyes peeled—these riff warriors might just surprise us when you least expect it! 

So bang your heads, raise those horns, and let’s ride this heavy wave ’cause THE DAMNED THINGS are wasting no time igniting the fire within! \m/ 

Check out the madness over at Metal Injection and fuel your metal obsession!

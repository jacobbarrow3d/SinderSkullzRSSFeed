Listen up, Pit Dwellers! Crank your necks around this news hotter than a broken microwave burrito: Izegrim, the riff storm raiders, are ready to shred a tsunami on this year's 70000 Tons of Metal cruise. Get ready to dive headfirst into a whiplash-inducing wall of distortion that's bound to void warranties and eardrums both.

Tagging along with them? Thirty years of soul-searing sonic bloodbath, celebrating an anniversary marked not by soft whispers, but by ear-bleeding anthems that would make your grandma slay her knitting needles in sheer terror.

Get ready to join the Chaos Congregation on this floating fortress of face-melting shred and don't forget your lifejackets cause this ain't no smooth sail, it's a goddamn fretboard massacre on high seas, baby!

'Til then, keep your coffee hot, your riffs heavy and your headbang injury reserve squad on speed dial. 

Your faithful Rekt Rebel, Sinder Skullz, signing off for now.
